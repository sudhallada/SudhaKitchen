				<b>1.</b>  &nbsp; Take wheat flour in a mixing bowl. Add salt and 2 tspns of oil to the flour. Then add water and start kneading. <br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do this till it turns into little harder dough. But Don’t make very harder dough. Once you prepared the dough, start making <br/>
				poori immediately. This prevents the poori from retaining more oil when it is deep fried.
	         </p>
			<p class="MethodPtag" >
				<b>2.</b> &nbsp; Make small balls of the dough and roll it into flat and round shaped poori sheets. This poori sheets should be little <br/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thick and the thickness should be uniform too. Apply flour if the dough sticks while rolling. Now this sheets are ready to deep fry.</p>
			<p class="MethodPtag">
				<b>3. </b>  &nbsp; Heat enough oil to sink the poori in a pan. When the oil is hot enough(the smoke will be coming out of the oil), <br/>
				    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place the poori sheets into the oil. Poori raises to the top. Now press the poori(the portion where poori is not raised) in to the oil<br/>
				     to make it pluffy at that part.
				</p>
			<p class="MethodPtag">
				<b>4.</b>  &nbsp;  Now turn the poori to the other side to fry.Once it turns into light brown color, take out the poori.
			</p>
			<p class="MethodPtag">
				<b>5.</b> &nbsp; Serve hot.<br/>
                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goes well with: All curries. Particularly with Potato curry.
